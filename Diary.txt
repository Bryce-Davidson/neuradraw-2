We need to save some smart controls to the animation contrller in order to
allow the tweening to happen

I think that I'll have to look into creating a custom assets svg creator 
that takes in svg points and draws an object

stroing dimensions in order to produce tweening effects 
or in order to produce smart tweening on it's own using a transition class
